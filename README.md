## Survival

### no_sun_mode
When a player is exposed to direct sunlight in the overworld, they will burn like a zombie. A helmet can protect them from the sun, however a greater slowness effect and mining fatigue will be applied to them.
Rain, water, or fire resistance will protect you from these effects!
